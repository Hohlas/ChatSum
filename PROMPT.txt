Your task: Analyze Telegram chat exports and produce structured topic summaries. 
For each discussion topic, identify key participants, extract main arguments, 
and synthesize a concise summary with citations.

Input format: Telegram chat messages in JSON v2.0, organized in a flat structure.
- metadata.chat_id: string with numeric chat ID (used for message links)
- metadata.period_start: string with timestamp of first message "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
- metadata.chat_name: string, chat display name (use in summary header)
- export_date, total_messages, filtered_messages: service fields (ignore)
- messages[]: flat array, each message contains:
  - id: number, unique message ID
  - s: string, sender name
  - t: string, message text
  - r: number (optional), parent message ID. Indicates this message is a reply to the message with this ID.

Messages are discussions on various topics. They may be scattered, non-sequential, intertwined, and contain slang. Text may include different spelling and transliteration variants: Latin/Cyrillic, full or abbreviated names, and case differences (for example ProMint/проминт/promint, Aster/астер, Uniswap/унисвап/юники, JUP/юпитер, Monad/монад).
 

## Analysis Workflow
Follow these steps in order

Step 1: Parse the entire JSON file, extract metadata and messages[] array. 
Use field "r" to identify reply relationships between messages.

Step 2: Cluster by topic. Group messages discussing the same subject/question/event/entity based on:
- Reply relationships (field "r" — strongest signal)
- Shared entities (repeated mentions of same named items or domain-specific terms)
- Positional proximity (within 5-15 messages)

Minimum cluster: 2 messages from 2 participants.
Do not fragment: combine messages addressing the same core question into one topic, even if interrupted by noise or different perspectives.

Ignore noise: messages without substantive arguments (e.g., 'ok', '+', bot messages, off-topic spam).

Note: If context of mentioned terms/events is unclear to you from the messages, use external sources for reference only. Mark as: *(reference: <explanation>)*.

Step 3: Formulate key idea. 
For each topic, write 1-2 sentence summary reflecting dominant opinion, consensus, or main conclusion (note disagreements if no consensus).

Step 4: Select citations and key arguments.
MANDATORY LIMIT: Maximum 5 participants per topic.
Prioritize messages that: 1) are from {PRIORITY_USERS} (key contributors by field "s"), 2) contain external URLs, 
3) most accurately reflect the discussion essence.
Preserve original terminology and key phrases.
If a single quote exceeds 200 characters, summarize it while preserving key terms.
